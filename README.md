## What is Renamer-2?

Renamer-2 is built to improve upon [renamerOnUpdate](https://github.com/stashapp/CommunityScripts/tree/main/plugins/renamerOnUpdate) by adding a more powerful, intuitive way to configure renaming rules. It is also built to be more performant than renamerOnUpdate.

## How do I use Renamer-2?

Please see the [user config demo](./src/user_config_demo.py)
